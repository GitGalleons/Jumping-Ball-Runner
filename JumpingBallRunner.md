**** I built **Jumping Ball Runner** as a single-file HTML game (canvas-based) with colorful parallax backgrounds, a cartoon ball, increasing speed, silly WebAudio sounds, high-score via `localStorage`, and a big ol’ retry button. Controls: **Space/↑/Tap** to jump, **R** to retry, **P** to pause. It’s lightweight, mobile-friendly, and pure vanilla.

### What you’ve got

* **Parallax sky, clouds, hills, and ground** for that juicy depth.
* **Cartoon ball** with eyes/pupils + shadow; obstacles are boxes/spikes with goofy faces.
* **Progressive difficulty**: speed multiplier ramps with time.
* **High score** saved in `localStorage`.
* **Funny sounds** (generated via WebAudio, no external assets).
* **Game over overlay** with Retry + Share.

### How to run

Just open the HTML file in any modern browser. That’s it. (No build. No deps. We love a simple life.)

### Best practices baked in

* **Device-pixel-ratio aware** rendering for crisp visuals.
* **Visibility pause** to chill CPU/battery on background tabs.
* **Forgiving hitbox** so it feels fair, not rage-quitty.
* **No external assets** → instant load, great for GitHub Pages/S3 hosting.

### Dev tips / mods (fast wins)

* **Tweak difficulty:** Change gravity, jump force, spawn cadence in the `state` / `spawnObstacle()` sections.
* **Add characters/skins:** Swap the player’s gradient fill or add a character picker overlay.
* **Accessibility:** Add a mute toggle and reduce-flash mode if you want to be extra considerate.
* **Analytics:** Hook a tiny event counter (scores, retries) if you deploy on production.

### Deploy quickies

* **GitHub Pages:** Drop the file in a repo → Settings → Pages → deploy from `main`.
* **AWS S3 + CloudFront:** Upload to S3, make it public behind CloudFront, set default root object to the HTML file.
* **Docker (optional):** Serve with `nginx:alpine` if you want containerized hosting on ECS/Fargate.

### Troubleshooting

* **No sound on first play (mobile):** AudioContext resumes on the first user gesture; tap once to start.
* **Blurry canvas:** The code handles DPR; if still fuzzy, check browser zoom or external CSS scaling.

### Tooling you might like

* **ESBuild or Vite** (if you split into modules later).
* **fxhash / seedrandom** (for deterministic fun runs).
* **Howler.js** only if you decide to add richer audio; for now WebAudio is lighter and fine.

**Suggested repo name:** `jumping-ball-runner` (clean, SEO-friendly).
If you want extra flair: `jumping-ball-runner-parallax` or `jbrunner`.
